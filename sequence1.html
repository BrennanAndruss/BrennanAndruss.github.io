        This artifact demonstrates my skill in being able to effectively brainstorm and get ideas down on paper. Just
        like with a personal journal, I write down whatever ideas come to mind without judgment, enabling me to rapidly
        generate ideas. For this activity, once all those questions were answered and all the thoughts generated by the
        prompts were written down, that's when I was able to filter through for the best ideas and biggest takeaways
        from the exercise, underlining what I liked the most and finding some gems to serve as the foundation of my
        literacy narrative.
