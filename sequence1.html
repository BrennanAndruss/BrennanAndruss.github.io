    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        Every project begins with an idea. Before I make a single thing in my game or my level, I think about all the
        various things I could create and list them all out. Even some of the most ridiculous ideas get added to the
        list. Once you obtain a full collection of ideas, you can then narrow down the list to your favorite ideas and
        find the idea that will become the foundation of your game. Writing a paper is no different, especially with a
        paper as open and expressive as this one. Before writing a single word, you should go through some process of
        brainstorming, be it through answering prompts or simply writing freely. Only then can you go in and decide what
        you want to get started writing about. However, choosing something doesn’t mean that list all of a sudden goes
        away. The writing process is not a straight line, but rather a circle; a cycle of drafting, reviewing, and
        revising. The process of brainstorming will generate many good ideas, and although your project will center
        around one or two of those, revisiting and incorporating those other ideas will round out your project and can
        be the thing that ties it all together.

    <h2>Drafting</h2>

      <p>
        This artifact demonstrates my skill in being able to effectively brainstorm and get ideas down on paper. Just
        like with a personal journal, I write down whatever ideas come to mind without judgment, enabling me to rapidly
        generate ideas. For this activity, once all those questions were answered and all the thoughts generated by the
        prompts were written down, that's when I was able to filter through for the best ideas and biggest takeaways
        from the exercise, underlining what I liked the most and finding some gems to serve as the foundation of my
        literacy narrative.

    <h2>Peer Review</h2>
    <section class="container reverse">
      <img src="images/sequence1-review.png" />
      <p>
        Sometimes, bringing new eyes onto your work can bring new ideas with it. Often a first draft will focus strongly
        on prominent ideas and certain aspects of the essay, which while good, can result in other ideas and other
        aspects being overlooked. For this first draft, I got into my journaling process and story much sooner and put a
        large emphasis on using vivid details and imagery, but I overlooked some of the background information leading
        into the story. Some of the ideas mentioned in the feedback were things I had thought of and written down in
        process artifacts, but I didn’t find these details to be as interesting or as important to my story at first.
        However, getting feedback from peers to elaborate on those background details made me aware of their importance
        in telling a complete story from beginning to end.

    <h2>Revising</h2>
    <section class="container">

      <p>
        In revising my narrative, I wanted to strike a balance between addressing the weak points suggested from peer
        reviews as well as further refine the strengths. This artifact shows the development and clarification of ideas,
        elaborating on the background information and giving more insight into my perspective in those sections as well
        as building upon the vivid descriptions and running metaphors present throughout my narrative. The revisions you
        make to an essay can vary greatly too, from rewriting whole sections to just a single word. For as many
        sentences and sections I rewrote or expanded, I made just as many micro adjustments to words and short phrases
        to smooth out some clunky sentences and improve the overall flow of the narrative.
