    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        As the developer of your own game, you know exactly how everything works. You know that the character will jump
        when you hit the 'A' button and move at a specific speed, you know that the player won't take damage from a
        certain enemy, and you know how long it will take the character to come to a stop from a full sprint,
        instinctively stopping right before the edge. However, as a player, that feel for the game must be acquired, and
        the game's mechanics must be carefully crafted to be intuitive and responsive to the player. If these issues go
        unfixed by developers and playtesters, your players may just keep running right off that edge. Same thing goes
        for writing. When writing a piece, you want to take into account the experience of your readers, giving them
        necessary
        background information and anticipating where they may need some additional explanation to fully understand a
        point. Changes and revisions along the way are important steps towards giving your audience the best experience
        possible.
