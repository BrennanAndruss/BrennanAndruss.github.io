    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        As the developer of your own game, you know exactly how everything works. You know that the character will jump
        when you hit the 'A' button, you know how fast the character will run when you hold down the 'Y' button, and you
        know how long it will take the character to come to a stop from a full sprint. When playing your own game,
        you'll instinctively stop running right before any cliffs. However, as a player, that feel for the game must be
        acquired, and the game's mechanics must be carefully crafted to be intuitive and responsive to the player. If
        these issues go unfixed by developers and playtesters, your players may just keep running right off that cliff.
        Same thing goes for writing. When writing a piece, you want to take into account the experience of your readers,
        giving them necessary background information and anticipating where they may need some additional explanation to
        fully understand a point. With both creating a game and writing an argumentative essay, the goal is to persuade
        your audience, whether that is to purchase and play your game or to read your essay and consider your position
        on the issue. Changes and revisions along the way are important steps towards giving your audience the best
        experience possible and ultimately win them over.

        Through writing this persuasive essay, I recognized many of these problems in reviewing and revising my writing.
        Compared to the other two sequences, the process in writing this piece involved much more time in the review and
        revision phases of the writing process. Through writing this persuasive essay, I accomplished educational
        objective #3:

    <h2>Drafting</h2>
    <section class="container">

      <p>
        This artifact shows the skill of developing and clarifying ideas. Simply brainstorming can often leave you with
        a long list of ideas and subtopics within the main topic, as the whole point of brainstorming is to lay
        everything out on the table. By being posed with questions that make you think critically and evaluate what you
        have, you can then begin to narrow down. Through thinking about and answering these questions, it allowed me to
        discover what pieces were the most important and which pieces I could develop the most. However, even with this
        activity, my scope was still too broad to tackle in a 4-6 page essay. The process of discovering and
        clarifying ideas is a continuous process during the drafting phase. I discovered new insights and connections
        through conducting research, and as a result, I reevaluated what I had and narrowed my scope further in order to
        fully develop my strongest ideas and best supported topics. Through further drafting, I would only continue to
        narrow my scope and focus on developing the most important ideas.

    <h2>Peer Review</h2>
    <section class="container reverse">
      <img src="images/sequence3-review.png" />
      <p>
        This artifact highlights a shortcoming in my original draft of the paper. In writing the first draft, I focused
        heavily on ethos and logos in an attempt to create strong, logical arguments with lots of evidence. Although I
        included lots of good evidence, my explanations of all that evidence fell short, leaving the reader with lots of
        work to do in order to fully understand my position. As the writer, I knew the details and intricacies of my
        issue, so some things that seemed obvious to
        me were left unexplained, but for readers who may be unaware of the issue, the lack of explanation could keep
        them feeling like outsiders. The feedback provided to me reminded me that no matter how good your idea may be, a
        product with a bad user experience is ultimately going to fall short. The peer reviews reminded me to take my
        readers into consideration and address the needs they may have in receiving the most seamless experience in
        reading.

    <h2>Revising</h2>
    <section class="container">
      <img src="images/sequence3-revision.png" />
      <p>
        While the revision process of some pieces may be quick and easy, with only a few minor or medium-sized tweaks,
        others can be a much longer process. This essay was one of the latter, as after adding more explanations and
        analysis needed for a better read, I went through a long process of rewording my entire essay in order to
        condense it. Conciseness is an important aspect of good writing, as you want to deliver information and
        explanations to your reader in an effective manner. Additionally, sometimes your project will have limits, be it
        hardware limitations for a game or a page limit for an essay. In order to deliver as much content to my audience
        as possible, I had to go through and trim out all the fat in my essay. Just like how my essay was about equity
        programs saving resources for the people who need it the most to be efficient, my revision process was about
        carefully selecting my words to effectively deliver information to my audience. By going through each and every
        word of my essay to fit the word limit while also adding in the further explanations suggested by peers, it
        forced me to fully clarify my ideas. Although it took a lot of work on my end, I feel that the changes I made
        resulted in an essay that was much easier and much more enjoyable to read while still delivering a message,
        which is always the desired outcome.
