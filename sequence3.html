    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        As the developer of your own game, you know exactly how everything works. You know that the character will jump
        when you hit the 'A' button and move at a specific speed, you know that the player won't take damage from a
        certain enemy, and you know how long it will take the character to come to a stop from a full sprint,
        instinctively stopping right before the edge. However, as a player, that feel for the game must be acquired, and
        the game's mechanics must be carefully crafted to be intuitive and responsive to the player. If these issues go
        unfixed by developers and playtesters, your players may just keep running right off that edge. Same thing goes
        for writing. When writing a piece, you want to take into account the experience of your readers, giving them
        necessary
        background information and anticipating where they may need some additional explanation to fully understand a
        point. Changes and revisions along the way are important steps towards giving your audience the best experience
        possible.

    <h2>Drafting</h2>
    <section class="container">

      <p>
        This artifact shows the skill of developing and clarifying ideas. Simply brainstorming can often leave you with
        a long list of ideas and subtopics within the main topic, as the whole point of brainstorming is to lay
        everything out on the table. By being posed with questions that make you think critically and evaluate what you
        have, you can then begin to narrow down. Through thinking about and answering these questions, it allowed me to
        discover what pieces were the most important and which pieces I could develop the most. However, even with this
        activity, I still have my scope too broad to tackle in a 4-6 page essay. The process of discovering and
        clarifying ideas is a continuous process during the drafting phase. I discovered new insights and connections
        through conducting research, and as a result, I reevaluated what I had and narrowed my scope further in order to
        fully develop my strongest ideas and best supported topics.

    <h2>Peer Review</h2>
    <section class="container reverse">
      <img src="images/sequence3-review.png" />
      <p>
        This artifact highlights a shortcoming in my original draft of the paper. In writing the first draft, I focused
        heavily on ethos and logos in an attempt to create strong, logical arguments with lots of evidence. Although I
        included lots of good evidence, my explanations of all that evidence fell short, leaving the reader with lots of
        work to do. As the writer, I knew the details and intricacies of my issue, so some things that seemed obvious to
        me were left unexplained, but for readers who may be unaware of the issue, the lack of explanation could keep
        them feeling like outsiders. The feedback provided to me reminded me that no matter how good your idea may be, a
        product with a bad user experience is ultimately going to fall short. The peer reviews reminded me to take my
        readers into consideration and address the needs they may have in receiving the most seamless experience in
        reading.

    <h2>Revising</h2>
    <section class="container">
      <img src="images/sequence3-revision.png" />
      <p>
        While the revision process of some pieces may be quick and easy, with only a few minor or medium-sized tweaks,
        others can be a much longer process. This essay was one of the latter, as I went through a long process of
        rewording my entire essay in order to condense it. Conciseness is an important aspect of good writing, as you
        want to deliver information and explanations to your reader in an effective manner. Additionally, sometimes your
        project will have limits, be it hardware limitations for a game or a page limit for an essay. In order to
        deliver as much content to my audience as possible, I had to go through and trim out all the fat in my essay.
        Just like how my essay was about equity programs saving resources for the people who need it the most to be
        efficient, my revision process was about carefully selecting my words to effectively deliver information to my
        audience. Although it took a lot of work on my end, I feel that the changes I made resulted in an essay that was
        much easier and much more enjoyable to read while still delivering a message, which is always the desired
        outcome.
