    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        In the process of developing your game, you'll often find yourself most attached to certain aspects, be it a
        particular game mechanic or level or something else. You'll jump right into designing and programming, but you
        may be blinded to the flaws. That's where playtesting comes in. By seeing others play your game and getting
        their feedback, you may realize that something just doesn't work. A similar trap appears in the writing process,
        as initial brainstorms will leave you with more ideas than you can put into a single essay. You'll choose what
        you believe to be your best idea to move forward with drafting and research, but you may run into the
        realization that your idea was not as great as your first thought it to be. Sometimes, your best ideas simply
        don't work out. Showing the early stages of your drafting or research to others can help you catch potential
        problems before you've gone too far in trying to make them work. By getting early feedback and realizing the
        flaws, you can then reevaluate and make a decision. Be bold enough
        to change directions and pursue new ideas, and you may discover a hidden gem.

    <h2>Peer Review</h2>

        Many times, you try to draft the entire thing before running it by anyone else, but through this activity, I
        gained initial feedback on my ideas and got constructive criticism early in the drafting process that ultimately
        led me to changing directions later on. By having to write 15 possible questions for an interview with my
        subject, it made me realize that I didn't have as much content as I would've liked for my piece. Many of my
        questions were repetitive. Peers reinforced those thoughts by pointing out this shortcoming in my questions.
        They also gave helpful tips on crafting better questions that would elicit more meaningful or in-depth
        responses. Having this early peer-review phase was very helpful to me for this piece, as it caused me to
        reevaluate my initial ideas and consider new directions. When I eventually did switch subjects, I could then
        reference back to these comments in generating new interview questions, making sure to do thorough research and
        create unique and well-crafted questions.

    <h2>Drafting</h2>

        In the initial creation of this artifact, I had a different subject in my mind for my portfolio. However, after
        doing
        some preliminary research, creating interview questions, and reaching out to my subject, I was unsure that I
        could be able to conduct an
        effective interview or if I would be able to conduct one at all. Around this same time, I had a new idea for a
        potential subject that excited me and would also be much more accessible to me for conducting interviews.
        Although I had already made progress, I felt that changing subjects would give me a better base to work from and
        ultimately result in a better paper, so I decided to take a step back and change gears.
        I maintained the foundational idea for my piece, being a focus on how individuals impact their communities, but
        I found a new subject to highlight and a new lens to see my idea through.

        A problem that persisted with both subjects I considered for this profile was not knowing where to find an
        image. I wanted something that fully captured the action of fostering community and being the center that
        keeps
        it thriving, but I couldn't find such an image. My drafts left out the image component completely, as all I
        had
        were ideas in the back of my mind. As the deadline got closer, I once again had to move on from that perfect
        idea in my mind and move on to the next one. With new expectations in mind, I set out to find something that
        captured the welcoming and collaborative feeling of the dorm community. Although the use of images didn't show
        off my subject the way I hoped, I feel that it still captured the spirit of my profile and fit well. With some
        searching, I found decorations throughout the floor that gave visual proof of the feeling of home I wrote out
        and demonstrated the bringing together of students in musical fashion.
